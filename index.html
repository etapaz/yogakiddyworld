        Would you like to enjoy the benefits of yoga with your family, with your students or during your yoga classes for children? <br><br>
        We offer 10 yoga cards in PDF format for free download, to introduce the youngest to this beautiful discipline of yoga that will strengthen them on a physical, emotional and spiritual level.

        <br><br>
        <h3>Why Yoga cards for children in PDF?</h3>
        <br>
        Yoga for kids may seem like a difficult task to teach; but it doesn't have to be, as there are many ways to teach yoga to kids in a fun and playful way; among them, we have a simple way, the attractive and beautifully illustrated yoga cards that you can get for free on this page. 

        <br><br>
        These children's yoga cards in PDF format will be a very practical, easy and fun way to teach yogic postures to the little ones, whether they are beginners or experienced.
        <br><br>
        If your child is in daycare, garden or school, with the yoga cards to print, they will be able to create entertaining group activities. On the other hand, if you want to practice yoga postures at home, these yoga cards will also be very useful for you as a parent. 

        <br><br>
        We recommend that for the more complicated yoga poses, children be guided by an adult to help them perform these poses correctly and thus avoid any injury.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>

          <br>


        Standing with your legs hip-width apart, as you inhale, bring your hands together in front of your chest and close your eyes imagining that you are greeting those around you with a beautiful smile. Stay in this pose for ten long, deep breaths. Then open your eyes and repeat three times.

        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Chair (Utkatasana)</h4>

       
        <a href="https://payhip.com/buy?link=CUtl" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/10 free yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy_3.jpg" alt="10 free yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy" width="120"/></a>

<br>
Sit in the center of the chair with your feet together on the floor. Raise your arms up to the sky, bring your knees together and lift yourself off the seat in order to draw a chair with your body. Your knees should be bent, so you should only lift a few centimeters off the chair. A hint for you to maintain strength and balance in your legs, is to keep your abdomen very active. Duration: one to three breaths.
