The Yoga Cards and the YogaKiddy game promote an integral wellness discipline through the practice of yoga approached as a game. 

  <br><br>

  <h2>How did we get started?  </h2>


  <a href="https://yogakiddy.org" target="blank">YogaKiddy</a> is a family adventure initiated in 2016 in Brussels, where as a yoga teacher (Julie Van Brabant - founder of the yoga center Santosha Brussels), I decided to create an alternative integrating play in the teaching of yoga to my young students. 

  <br><br>
  Since then, YogaKiddy has been providing thousands of people with educational materials that facilitate the practice of yoga, useful for all professionals who work with children, such as: educators, psychologists, speech therapists and pediatricians, among others. It is also highly recommended for activities involving parents, grandparents and the family in general. 

  <br><br>
  After a lot of hard work, love and dedication we are proud to have, at the moment, more than ten thousand families and education professionals using our tools to teach yoga to the little ones. 
  <br><br>
  YogaKiddy Academy also offers yoga training weekends for children around the world. The countries where we offer these trainings are: Spain, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, France and Belgium. Recognizing the importance of creating alternatives that allow children, and families in general, to achieve physical and mental balance in the face of the stress and dynamics of modern life, we continue to develop tools and activities to promote this discipline, and its beautiful teachings, to children and their families.

  Aware of the importance of creating alternatives that allow children, and the family in general, to achieve physical and mental balance in the face of the stress and dynamics of modern life today, we continue to develop tools and activities to promote this discipline, and its beautiful teachings, to children and those around them. 
  <br><br>

  The goal is to instill healthy values and habits from an early age. And what better way to do this than with colorful cards that help not only to improve the physical state of the children, but also their mental and spiritual state.
