<h3>ðŸ’¡ Few ideas on how to use the yoga cards for kids</h3>
<br>
Here are some ideas for activities you can do with the YogaKiddy cards for kids:
<br><br>
<strong>Story</strong>: make up a story with the different characters/animals on the cards inviting children to do the postures individually and/or in groups. Choose the cards according to the category and theme of the story. The material becomes a support for the story.
<br><br><b>Mystery bag</b>: inside, you keep some of the postures to work on using the surprise factor in a fun way. The children pick a card at random and present the asana to the rest of the group.<br><br>
<b>Yoga stations</b>: mark out the space according to your interests and create stations where in each of them they will have to do certain postures, their sounds and whatever your imagination. Examples: The Celestial Station (star, butterfly, eagle, mountain postures) or the Balance Station (tree, plane, dancer postures).
<br><br>
<strong>Guess who I am</strong>: Take turns calling out the characteristics of the asana for the rest of the group to guess. When the posture is discovered, everyone does it.
<br><br><strong>Discover their names</strong>: on each card, you will find the name of the asana in english and in Sanskrit when available, which will allow you to start the reading-writing process. The game consists in identifying each letter in order to obtain the total reading and then to decipher the posture. To really encourage reading, the image of the asana should be covered, leaving only the observation of its name.<br><br>
And last but not least, teach yoga while having fun and learning.

        Sit on the floor with your legs wide apart. Grip your left foot with your left hand and bring it toward your ear.
        Bring your right hand closer to your right leg and try to touch your knee, calf or toes.
        Take two deep breaths and switch sides.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Monkey (Vatayanasana)</h4>

<img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__4.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" /><br>

          In the mountain pose, breathe in by spreading your legs beyond the width of your hips with your toes turned outward.
Exhale, bend your legs and lower your hips. Your knees should be in line with your ankles. Raise your hands to the sky, bending your elbows and leaving the palms of your hands facing the sky. If you want, you can bring one of your hands above your head and imagine that you are a dancing monkey full of energy. Try to keep your back straight.
Stay in this pose for three long, deep breaths. Then start again.


        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Cowboy (Vatayanasana)</h4>

    
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__5.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />

        Bring your hands together in front of your chest and try to keep your back straight.

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__7.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__8.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        
          <br>
          Stand up, spread your legs beyond the width of your hips. Rotate the toes on your right foot to the right and the toes on your left foot slightly inward. Bend your right knee and raise your arms toward the sky next to your ears. Look up at the sky and feel the strength of a dinosaur inside you.
          Stay in this pose for five long, deep breaths. Then switch sides.
          

          
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Cow (Bitilasana)</h4>
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__9.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__10.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
       
        <br>

        Get down on all fours, i.e. kneel with your hands on the floor, as if you were forming a table. Knees are at hip and wrist level, just below the shoulders, with your back straight. Breathe in deeply. Raise your pelvis and head at the same time lowering your stomach as much as possible. 
        Look up at the sky and imagine you are a cow enjoying the fresh country air. Mmmmmmmooooo!
        Then, as you exhale, lower your head and pelvis and bend your back. Don't go too fast, follow the rhythm of your breathing.
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Unicorn (Gomukhasana)</h4>

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__11.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__12.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />

        <br>
        Start with the staff position (Dandasana). Then bend your right knee over your other knee, and bring your right foot as close to your left hip as possible.
        Then bring your left leg toward your right hip. Be sure to place your legs as symmetrically as possible, overlapping your knees and keeping your back straight.
        Next, raise your arms to the sky and, as you breathe in, cross your hands above your head. Take three breaths and start again, now from the other side.
        
        <br><br><br>





        <h4>Siren
          (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana)</h4>
          <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__13.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
          <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__14.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <br>

        Sit with your legs straight and spread them slightly apart. Bend your right leg to try to touch your left thigh with your foot. Then bring your left foot back. Raise your arms behind your head to try to cross your fingers. If you can, slowly bend your left knee and try to your left elbow on your foot.
        Breathe slowly and try to keep your back straight and your chest facing forward. Relax your foot, slowly lower your leg. Now repeat the pose on the other side.
        
        
     


        <br><br><br>

        
        <h4>Kayak (Navasana)</h4>
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__15.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__16.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />

        <br>
        Sit with a straight back and straight legs. Place your hands on the floor behind your back and stretch your spine. Lift your feet off the floor with your legs bent, then remove your hands from the floor and place your arms parallel to the floor.
Stay in position for five long, deep breaths and then repeat.

        <br><br><br>


        <h4>Angel (Vrksasana)</h4>

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__17.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__18.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <br>


        Stand up and bring your hands together in front of your chest. Smile! Place one foot on the opposite thigh. If it's too difficult, bring your foot down to your calf or even to your ankle. But never over your knee.
        Stay in position for three long, deep breaths. Then switch sides.
        

        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Egg (Apanasana)</h4>

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__19.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__20.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <br>
        Lie on your back, bring your knees to your chest and hold them tightly in your arms. If this is difficult for you, you can wrap your arms around your thighs.
        Keep your back flat on the floor and try to keep your neck in line with your back. Your shoulders should relax and your head should rest on the floor.
        Stay in position for three long, deep breaths. Then start again.
        


        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Lion (Simhasana)</h4>

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__21.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__22.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <br>
        Get on your knees, put your feet on the ground and rest your buttocks on your heels.
        Place your palms on the floor between your legs, with your fingers pointing toward you. Look up slightly, breathe in deeply through your nose, open your mouth and exhale with your tongue poking out.
        Stay in position for three long, deep breaths. Then start again.
        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Indian (Upavesasana)</h4>
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__23.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__24.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
      
        <br>
        Crouch down and gather your hands in front of your heart, with your fingers pointing upwards whilst resting your elbows on your knees.
Hold the pose for a few seconds and start again.

        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Pigeon (Rajakapotasana)</h4>

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__25.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__26.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <br>
        Lie on your stomach.
        Put your hands on your shoulders and lean your body back.
        Then slowly lift up both feet and try to touch your head with them.
        Look at the sky and imagine that you are flying like a pigeon!
        Hold the pose for a few seconds and try again.
        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Cat (Marjaryasana)</h4>
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__27.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__28.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
      
        <br>
        Get down on all fours. The palms of your hands rest on the floor at shoulder level and your knees at hip level.
        As you breathe in, arch your back, lowering your belly button to the ground and raising your head to the sky. Stretch your neck while raising your tailbone as high up as possible. Stretch your stomach and waist and smile big. When you look up at the sky, you can meow like a cat to the end of your breath.
        As you exhale, curve your spine as much as possible, with your chin pressing up against your chest. Tilt your head forward and try to place your chin in the small hollow just below your throat. Continue to alternate between arched back and rounded back for five long, deep breaths.
        
        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Flower (Vikasitakamalasana)</h4>
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__29.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__30.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
      
        <br>
        Begin by posing as a butterfly, sitting with the soles of your feet close together and your back straight.
Place your arms under your legs, keeping the palms of your hands facing up.
Inhale, tuck in your stomach and lift your legs off the ground, try to keep your chest up and smile!
Do this pose five times, following the rhythm of your breathing.

        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Bamboo (Ardha Chandrasana)</h4>

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__31.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__32.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <br>
        To perform this posture, start standing, with your feet together and raise your arms to grab your right wrist with your left hand. Your arms should be kept stretched while inhaling air through the nose; when you exhale, bend your body to the left as much as possible without turning the core. Lower your arms and repeat now to the right side.
        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Diamond (Vajrasana)</h4>

        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__33.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__34.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <br>
        This posture is performed kneeling on the floor with the feet together and the insteps stretched on the floor. The tailbone rests on the heels, the palms of the hands are kept on the knees and the back remains straight. Inhalation and exhalation are always through the nose, in a relaxed manner.
To help immobility, you can fix your gaze on a specific point that the child finds in front of him or her.

<br><br><br>
<h4>Screw (Parivritta Sukhasana)</h4>

<img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__35.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
<img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__36.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />

<br>
Choose a partner. Sit back-to-back with your legs crossed. Each place your right hand on your left knee and your left hand on the other person's right knee. Stay in the posture for three long, deep breaths. Then turn in the opposite direction. Repeat the pose twice on each side. 

        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Sleeping mummy (Svanasana)</h4>
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__37.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__38.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
      
        <br>
        To perform this posture, lie on your back with your legs and arms slightly apart, with the palms of your hands facing upwards. With your eyes closed and relaxing your body. Breathe through your nose and you should remain in the pose feeling and paying close attention to the body and the breath.
        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Paddling</h4>
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__39.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
        <img src="images/yoga cards pdf kids children yogakiddy__40.jpg" alt="yoga cards kids children pdf download" />
      
        <br>
        Choose a partner and sit across from each other. Place the soles of your feet against your partner's and take his or her hands. As you inhale, pull your partner forward and as you exhale, let yourself be pulled. When you move forward, you can bend your knees slightly. Repeat this movement ten times. 
        
        
        <br><br><br>
        <h4>Sledge</h4>
