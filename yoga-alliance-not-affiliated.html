        Yoga Alliance has been a topic of conversation and discussion among many yoga instructors and scholars, mainly because of the issue of the little validity of their certificate and the way they handle such certification, so it is not strange to see how more and more people and institutions, like us, want to have nothing to do with this organization. <br><br>But why are you distancing yourself from an organization with such worldwide recognition and fame?
        <br><br><br><br>
       <h2> An organization with dubious practices </h2>
        Let's start with the basics, what is Yoga Alliance and how does its certification work? Yoga Alliance is an international, non-profit yoga organization that ideally should serve as a "proof of quality" for yoga instructors and schools worldwide. Yoga Alliance certification is believed to give you credibility and endorsement as a school or instructor, as well as various "benefits".
        <br><br>
        The problem begins when you start to see the seams of its authenticity. This certification is supposed to be a proof that ratifies the experience and knowledge in the world of yoga, but to obtain this certificate no particular guidelines are followed and there is no proof that you have the experience and adequate knowledge to teach. This makes it lose its validity and credibility in the eyes of experienced instructors and schools.
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2>The exam that no one fails </h2>
        The RYT certificate, which stands for Registered Yoga Teacher, as well as the RYS or Registered Yoga School is obtained by completing 200 hours of training in any school registered with the organization and paying the registration and renewal fee. For schools, at least one of their directors must be certified by the alliance.
        <br><br>
        It should be noted that knowledge and experience are not checked to obtain such a certificate, since Yoga Alliance uses a trust-based system: presenting a certification that says that you have completed 200 hours is enough for them. 
        <br><br>The problem with this system is that no one checks to see if you have actually completed the 200 hours, which means that any individual who gets a fake certification (either because they paid a yoga school or because they are friends with a certified instructor) is eligible for the RYT certificate. <br><br>Considering that after getting the certificate and paying the fees you could officially start your own yoga school, it is a huge failure not to check the quality of the teachers.
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2> The other requirement is to pay the fees</h2>
        
        Registration fee: A one-time registration fee is $50 USD for instructors and $400 USD for schools.
        USD for schools.
        Annual Renewal: must be paid together with the registration fee and then annually. $65 USD for instructors and $240 USD for schools.
        This leaves a total of $115 USD for the RYT and $640 USD for the RYS, plus the 200 hours of untested training. After that, you need to pay the annual renewal fee on time in order to remain part of the alliance, i.e. if you stop paying, you are no longer a "certified instructor", which in our opinion is inconsistent.
        <br><br>
        If you have already demonstrated that you are qualified to teach, how could you lose that training just because you don't pay an annual fee?
        <br><br>
        Or in the event that it is necessary to confirm annually that the teacher or institution continues to provide the appropriate service, why not accompany that annual fee requirement with an actual evaluation of the activities being performed? The truth is that the alliance at no time is concerned about the content that is taught either in the 200 hours of training (if you actually practice) or in the classes following the delivery of your certificate.
        <br><br> <br><br>
        <h2>Affiliation and its imaginary benefits </h2> 
      
        Honestly, the benefits you can get from Yoga Alliance are not as great as they seem:
        <br><br>
        Not being certified does not prevent you from gaining all the knowledge and experience necessary to teach yoga classes, just as it does not prevent you from running a yoga school.
        <br><br>The big yoga schools are not interested in certification because, like us, they value experience more than a document that says you are fit to teach. <br><br>
        Many of the great yoga teachers, with over 20 or 30 years of experience, are not certified by the alliance, so it is not a prerequisite.
        They offer to "Advocate to protect the yoga community from unfair or unnecessarily complicated patents, taxes or government regulations," but there is no evidence of any case where they have actually done so.
        <br><br>
        When yoga schools do not apply for Yoga Alliance certification many of the great instructors do not fall foul of certification, and still manage to spread their knowledge.  <br><br>
        If paying an annual fee is the only thing that entitles anyone to keep their "valid" title, we don't see why it would be worth trying to get the certificate.
        <br><br>
        Taking into account the above points, it is clear that Yoga Alliance does not care about the quality of the instructors and schools that make up the alliance, and gives more value to the money you have than to the experience. This goes against our vision of yoga and what we teach on a daily basis. We value the experience above all else.
        <br><br>
        On the Yoga Alliance website you will read that one of their key points, in the mission section, is "To guide yoga teachers and schools to achieve success with conscious and effective business practices.", where again it is evident that their management is profit oriented rather than experience oriented.
        <br><br>
        Love, breath, compassion and experience as true tools for Yoga.
        A Yoga Alliance certificate will not make you fit to start teaching, just as lacking such a certificate does not leave you unable to teach. 
        
        <br><br>Yoga goes beyond money and what such a document says, for at the moment of truth, the knowledge, experience and physical prowess of the instructors and their students will be the true evidence.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, every day more and more untrained people with no interest in growing as a yogi obtain a certification from the Yoga Alliance, which creates a deficiency in teaching and can even discourage future yogis from continuing in this lifestyle. 
        
        
        <br><br>For this reason, we take care to give priority to the experience, perseverance and acquired knowledge of future yoga instructors.
       
        <br><br>
        While Yoga Alliance continues to demand its fees and certify many people without offering anything in return, we continue to practice and try to improve ourselves every day to guarantee you a pleasant experience of the highest quality, and to show you that despite the fact that teachers and institutions need funding to continue their work, the true goal of yoga is love, breath and compassion, not certifications without meaning.
